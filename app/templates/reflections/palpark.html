              <p>Palisades Park had our smallest turnout yet - only two students - but it turned out to be one of our best workshop experiences! Travis and Carlos are both some of the coolest sixth grader I've ever met. David and I were the only teachers there, the one to one ratio meant that we were able to work a lot more closely together and do a lot more than we would have been able to if there had been more students. </p>
              <br>
              <p>Travis had actually been the only student at the first session, which I had not gone to. They were able to go through the entire HTML/CSS lesson plan, and so for this session Travis and Carlos were down for doing something different. We started off planning to work on building with Microsoft's Minecraft Education program, but the library wifi was not optimal for downloading the application. So instead, we off the fly taught a workshop on Scratch!</p>
              <br>
              <p>David and I had never really used Scratch before, but things turned out pretty well! We started off with a few small programs like animating the Scratch cat and animating our names, and then we worked through recreating some of the starter project games. We spent the most time on making/remixing pong, which Travis and Carlos really enjoyed. We were able to teach basic concepts like loops and conditionals and we goofed around a lot with changing up the game, such as with my impossible to win version. I remember being a little hesitant at first because of the lack of students, but I shouldn't have been worried. The overall experience was an absolute blast and we ended up having so much fun :)</p>
